Hey guys, this is my Final Project's REPO.

I would recoommend reading through the PDF first as it has everyting setup, it is literally 60 pages+, I just feel running the code might take too long.

Highly Reccommend just going through the PDF instead of trying to run the project, it will work, it just might take way too long.

DTSA 5511 PDF is the Final project, both the notebook and the pdf are named the exact same way. 

You can ignore tuner_dir, it just has information from the project through it's runs, I just added it in because it was created in the process of making this. 


THERE IS A TYPO INSIDE THE REPOSITORY, I NAMED THE FINAL DTSA 5011 FOR ONE OF THE IPYNB FILES, IT IS THE CORRECT FILE, BUT I HAVE ALSO ADDED THE CORRECT NAME FOR THE SAME FILE AGAIN IN GITHUB.
